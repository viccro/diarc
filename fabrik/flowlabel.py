""" flowlabels are abbreviations that can be used to identify a hook. Flows do
    not have a single unique attribute, which makes them difficult to identify.
    flows solve that problem.

    flowlabels have 2 parts:
        origin node index
        destination node index

    Example:
        flowlabel 1_2 means the flow from the node at index 1 to the node at index 2
